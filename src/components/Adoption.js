  <p>While Phase One of our campus is concentrated on our immediate needs - medical treatment, housing, adoption and care of our dogs.   Phase Two takes Dog Rescue to the next level with a focus on education and sustainability.  Included will be a training center for canine companions of PTSD veterans, a dog boarding facility, and a 10,000 square foot education and event barn to provide community services and events that will make the ranch a true destination for animal lovers.</p>
